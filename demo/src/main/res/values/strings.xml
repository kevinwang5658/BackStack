        Next up is state. New view groups can have state passed in through their constructor.
        For the demo, we\'re going to pass in a random number to the next view group. The passed in
        value is persisted through rotations.

        Try rotating the screen. You can see that number doesn\'t change even though it was passed
        in through the view group\'s constructor. Be careful not to capture any references
        to the activity when using this feature.

        The view is translucent so you can see the retained view underneath. This view was also added to a different container.
